---TASK CREATED - 13-May-2020 BY Guilfoyle Ciaran AND ALLOCATED TO Bob Samual DUE BY 14-May-2020---
Sam
We want your developers to use source control
Please outline to use what you propose and we will consider it
THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER MODULES UNTIL THIS IS PUT IN PLACE SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST ACCEPT IT!&nbsp; :-)
####Bob Samual has added the following comment to this Task on 14 May 2020#### Please let us know what type of source control you want because currently we don't use any online source control like GitHub as we are not familiar with that because we have been coding since GitHub even existed. We have a practice of taking daily backup at the end of each day's session on our local computer and we keep that daily backup for upto 30 days, this is something we are successfully doing for all the projects and we have not had any issue since over a decade now. So, please advise what source control you propose?

####Bob Samual has added the following comment to this Task on 15 May 2020#### Sorry we do not have experience using any 3rd party source control system. We just take backup of sourcefiles everyday for a periodic cycle of 30 days.

About 2 months ago this was raised as an issue
the partners raise the issue

I had experience for many years in software development - and it was a little different for sure, but at the time we used visual source safe.....

You can see this as AN OBSTICLE AND A PROBLEM
OR

You can see this as AN OBSTICLE AND A PROBLEM
OR
You can see this as an opertunity to learn a new skill

BUT
WITHOUT SOURCE CONTROL YOU WILL NOT BE DEVELOPING ANY MORE MODULES.
That is the decision that OTHER PEOPLE have made!

Extermal Software consultants Armour Interactive - first question Source Contorol?
External Software Security company - first question Source control?
Software Developer from the Legal Side of GBS & Co (not the accounts side) - Source control.....

So lets, me and you, look at this together and make it happen - and hey YOU LEARN A NEW SKILL at no cost to you.

####Bob Samual has added the following comment to this Task on 16 May 2020#### Okay I understand but we need some time to learn one of the free source version control system available out there and will keep you posted on this once we get our hands on it. Please bear with us for a few days.

####Guilfoyle Ciaran has added the following comment to this Task on 17 May 2020#### Ok please sue GitHub - it is free - it is very very popular - it is easy - there is a great github community
If eventually there is a cost to it WE will pay it NOT YOU

but I have looked at it and it is easy....
