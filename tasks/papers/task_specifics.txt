how much would it cost in hours for your developer to sit down and assess the PAYE MRS system to see if there is a better more efficient way the code could be done to speed up the PAYE MRS system...

####Bob Samual has added the following comment to this Task on 07 Sep 2020#### Hi Ciaran, actually I would like my developer to check the website on your computer so he can get better understanding on the lagging issue you are experiencing on PAYE MRS system. Maybe when we are on Skype call I will have my developer access your computer via Logmein or Anydesk. Please let me know your availability for this next week.
