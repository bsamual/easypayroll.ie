We noticed that the system is getting "timeout" error. Its because we are sending too much of data at once. We are investigating on this to see if we can extend the time or else we wil need to send data in batch. We will update you on this soon, Please bear with us for a day or two.

regards
Sam

It looks like there is some issue when generating PDF as it takes more time and that resulting in "Timeout issue" so we need more time to investigate on this issue so this may take us upto a week or so to do detailed analysis on this and find a solution. Please bear with us.

regards
Sam
